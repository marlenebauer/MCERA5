# MCERA5 

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

'MCERA5' is designed to simplify the download and analysis of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts ReAnalysis 5 (ERA5) family.
It simplifies the downloading of ERA5 datasets by summarizing 

It uses the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts [`ecmwfr` package](https://github.com/bluegreen-labs/ecmwfr) in `R` to interface the ECMWFR API web service and access the ERA5 data from the [![Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home)].
## Installation
'MCERA5' is not yet on CRAN, so it needs to be installed via GitHub.
You can install the latest development version of 'MCERA5' like this:

``` {r}
remotes::install_github("marlenebauer/MCERA5") &
remotes::install_github("chrissikrause/MCERA5")
```
Users require a user ID and API key to access the Copernicus Store Data (CDS) API which can be found at their [![CDS profile](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/login)].

Additionally, you need to download the 'rgeoboundaries' package from GitHub to exploit the entire capability of 'MCERA5':
```{r}
remotes::install_github("wmgeolab/rgeoboundaries")
library(rgeoboundaries)
```

## Get started
After successfully installed, you can load the package as below and work with the provided functions.
```{r example}
library(MCERA5)

# Download monthly ERA5 land data
# for winter season

user <- "Your user ID"
key <- " Your personal API key"
dataset_short_name <- "reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means"
product_type <- "monthly_averaged_reanalysis"
variable <- "2m_temperature"
StartDate <- "2009-12-01"
EndDate <- "2020-02-29"
season <- "DJF"
time = sprintf("%02d:00", 4:5) # c("04:00", "05:00")
country_name <- "Germany" # provided by the 'rgeoboundaries' package
# call the get_era5 function
# optional parameters need to be called as shown below
data <- get_era5(user, key, dataset_short_name, variable, StartDate, EndDate, time, season=season, country_name=country_name, product_type=product_type)
## basic example code
```
An overview of the ERA5 family datasets with all available dataset_short_names and product_types is provided [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Climate+Data+Store+%28CDS%29+API+Keywords#ClimateDataStore(CDS)APIKeywords-ERA5familydatasets)
A list of all available variables for ERA5-Land can be found [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5-Land%3A+data+documentation) and for ERA5 [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation).


Analysis of raster data on monthly level
```{r example}
result <- raster_analysis(data)
# Plot the slope of result
result_plot <- monthly_plots(result, "mean", "output_file.png")
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
