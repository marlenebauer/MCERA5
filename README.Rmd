# MCERA5

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

**MCERA5** is designed to simplify the download and analysis of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts ReAnalysis 5 (ERA5) family. It uses the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts  [`ecmwfr package`](https://github.com/bluegreen-labs/ecmwfr) in `R` to interface the ECMWFR API web service and access the ERA5 data from the [Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home).


The package is designed to:

- Be user-friendly and provide a simple interface to access the ERA5 data.
- Download ERA5 data for a specific time period, variable, and area of interest with several filter options.
- Perform time-series analysis for the ERA5 data.
- Visualize the ERA5 data and results of the analysis.


## Installation

`MCERA5` is not yet on CRAN, so it needs to be installed via GitHub. You can install the latest development version of `MCERA5` like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("marlenebauer/MCERA5")
```

Users require a user ID and API key to access the Copernicus Store Data (CDS) via the Ecmwfr API which can be found at their [CDS profile](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/login).

Additionally, you need to download the `rgeoboundaries` package from GitHub to exploit the entire capability of `MCERA5`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("wmgeolab/rgeoboundaries")
library(rgeoboundaries)
```

## Example

After successfully installed, you can load the package as below and work with the provided functions:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(MCERA5)
```


For downloading ERA5 data, call the `get_era5` function.

The provided example will download temperature data for Germany between December 2009 and February 2020 for the winter months (December, January February) at 4:00 and 5:00 UTC.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
user <- "Your user ID"
key <- " Your personal API key"
dataset_short_name <- "reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means"
product_type <- "monthly_averaged_reanalysis"
variable <- "2m_temperature"
StartDate <- "2009-12-01"
EndDate <- "2020-02-29"
season <- "DJF"
time = sprintf("%02d:00", 4:5) # c("04:00", "05:00")
country_name <- "Germany" # provided by the `rgeoboundaries` package
# call the get_era5 function
# optional parameters need to be called as shown below
data <- get_era5(user, key, dataset_short_name, variable, StartDate, EndDate, time, season=season, country_name=country_name, product_type=product_type)
```


The data can for example analyzed by the `raster_analysis` function.
This function groups input data by months and calculates statistics over time period of data set. Available parameters are mean, median, min, max, Sen Slope, Mann-Kendall tau and Mann-Kendall p-value.
This will calculate the mean temperature value for each month over time.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
result <- raster_analysis(data)
# Plot the slope of result
result_plot <- monthly_plots(result, "mean", "output_file.png")
```

### Additional Information about the ERA5 family datasets

An overview of the ERA5 family datasets with all available dataset_short_names and product_types is provided [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Climate+Data+Store+%28CDS%29+API+Keywords#ClimateDataStore(CDS)APIKeywords-ERA5familydatasets). A list of all available variables for ERA5-Land can be found [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5-Land%3A+data+documentation) and for ERA5 [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation).
