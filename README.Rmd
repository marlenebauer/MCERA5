# MCERA5 

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

'MCERA5' is designed to simplify the download and analysis of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts ReAnalysis 5 [![(ERA5)](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets)] family.
It uses the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts [`ecmwfr` package](https://github.com/bluegreen-labs/ecmwfr) in `R` to use the ECMWFR API web service and access the ERA5 data from the [![Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/home)].
## Installation
'MCERA5' is not yet on CRAN, so it needs to be installed via GitHub.
You can install the latest development version of 'MCERA5' like this:

``` {r}
remotes::install_github("marlenebauer/MCERA5") &
remotes::install_github("chrissikrause/MCERA5")
```
Users require a user ID and API key to access the Copernicus Store Data (CDS) API which can be found at their [![CDS profile](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/login)].

Additionally, you need to download the 'rgeoboundaries' package from GitHub to exploit the entire capability of 'MCERA5':
```{r}
remotes::install_github("wmgeolab/rgeoboundaries")
library(rgeoboundaries)
```

## Get started
After successfully installed, you can load the package like this and work with the provided functions.
```{r example}
library(MCERA5)
## basic example code
```



What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
